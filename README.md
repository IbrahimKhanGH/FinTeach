## 💡 Inspiration

Our journey began with a simple memory of school pizza parties, which led to a profound realization: teachers often spend their own money to create special moments for their students. This understanding deepened when we learned about educators taking on side jobs, like one of our high school teachers who delivered DoorDash during school hours, just to make ends meet.

This reality check inspired us to create FinTeach—a tool that addresses the unique financial challenges teachers face while honoring their dedication to education.
